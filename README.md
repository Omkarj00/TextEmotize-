Emotion Detection App is a Python-based project utilizing Scikit-learn and Streamlit to create a text classifier model for emotion detection in textual data. The project involves data loading, preprocessing, model building, and training using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. A user-friendly Streamlit app allows real-time emotion predictions. The code is adaptable, encouraging experimentation with models and customization of the app's appearance. The project provides a foundation for NLP applications and machine learning projects.
